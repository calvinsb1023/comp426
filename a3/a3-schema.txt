 * (StudentFirstName, StudentLastName, CourseName, Semester) was choosen as the
 * primary key since a student cannot take a class more than once during a given
 * semester.
 *
 * If dealing with the full student body and its courses, it would be better for 
 * size and performance to split into maybe three tables: 1) Students, 2) 
 * Professors, 3) Courses, each with foreign keys that point to each other to 
 * reflect enrollment and instructors, but since there are only 300 records, a 
 * single table suffices.
